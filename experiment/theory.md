### INTRODUCTION<br>

<p style="text-indent:50px; text-align:justify;">Alkalinity is the presence of sufficient alkaline ions in water. The absence of alkalinity makes the water acidic. Water is said to be alkaline when pH of water is above 7.00. The determination of alkalinity is very useful in water and waste water because it provides buffering to resist changes in pH value. The alkalinity and acidity in water usually changes in natural waters with large algal growth. The alkalinity of natural waters is primarily due to the salts of week acids and bicarbonates represent the major form of alkalinity. Alkalinity can be expressed as follows:</p>

<p align="center">Alkalinity (mol/l) = [HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>] + 2[CO<sub>3</sub> <sup>2-</sup>] + [OH<sup>-</sup>] â€“ [H<sup>+</sup>]</p>

<p style="text-indent:50px; text-align:justify;">The presence of alkalinity in surface waters is primarily indicates the concentration of carbonate, bicarbonate and hydroxide contents. Alkalinity in excess of Alkaline earth metal concentrations is significant in determining the suitability of a water for irrigation. Alkalinity measurements are used in the interpretation and control of water and waste water treatment processes. Raw domestic waste water has an alkalinity less than or only slightly greater than that of the water supply.</p>

<p style="text-indent:50px; text-align:justify;">Alkalinity of water is the capacity of water to neutralize acid. It is usually expressed as Total Alkalinity or Caustic Alkalinity in water. It is significant in many uses and treatments of natural waters and wastewaters. Alkalinity is measured titrimetrically by titrating against Dilute Sulphuric Acid. Phenolphthalein and Methyl Orange are used as indicator to indicate pH 8.3 and pH 4.3. Phenolphthalein process a pink colour when pH is above 8.3 and colourless when pH is below 8.3.</p>
